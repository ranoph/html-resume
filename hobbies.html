    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>Learning is one of the most important things that anyone can do honestly, it's how we get better and improve ourseleves, and so honestly I love to learn. As of right now, I'm learning how to be somewhat proficiend in HTML and then transitioning into CSS so I can be a decent web developer. I just found a way to insert a button and use an anchor command to lead it to this page from my original Resume and I cannot tell you how happy that made me. Regardless though, learning is definitely one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
    <h2>Instruments</h2>
    <p>When it comes to playing instruments, I've had around 10 years of experience with playing the piano. There have been so many times where I've been able to release emotions that I may be feeling through playing the piano and it's honestly such a nice ability to have. Most people think the piano is difficult but honestly are so wrong. Piano is like coding in a  way, all you need to do is know a language to get started. Knowing how to read the music notes within sheet music and where they correlate to on the keys is all you need to be able to play. All that's left is practice. I've recently been eager to try and learn how to play the electric guitar, which is why I've been saving up enough money to buy one. I'm currently broke right now though because I spent all my money ona brand new pc and monitor in order to learn how to code properly and not on a slow laptop. </p>
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>Honestly a little basic but you know, I feel like many coders started out this way, being on their computers just way too much and finding a profession that coincidentally allowed more of an excuse to be on the computer for even longer. I grew up with many great games such as Mario, MW3, Sonic, and many other games. I mainly started getting into gaming when Fortnite was released back in 2017. It was the beginning of a gaming addiction in a way, and led me to own this PC in order to play and code at the same time.</p>
