    <h1>My Resume</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As a student of code, I have just began taking classses on Udemy to become familiar with web development and the usage of HTML and CSS. I find myself extremely passionate about the topic and can definitely see myself working on personal projects the more I learn. As of right now, I aspire to have the privilege in obtaining an internship where I can expand my understanding on computer science in hopes of being able to achieve my goals of becoming a software engineer.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Currently, I am enrolled within a community college in hopes of transferring to my four-year dream school: UCI. I plan to pursue my studies of computer science at UCI and at any internships I may find myself obtaining. As for my high school years, I've taken multiple advanced placement tests, and have taken two years worth of computer classes, utilizing 3D printers, and applications such as TinkerCad to program robots.</p>
